For example this recent article from Simon Portegies Zwart (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.11295.pdf) claims that one should not use python because it is inefficient, and therefore more environmentally harmful.\n","\n","However, this statement was demonstrated to be untrue by Pierre Augier (see links from https://physicsworld.com/a/the-huge-carbon-footprint-of-large-scale-computing/). Augier argues that while python will be slower than other languages if one does not consider optimization (often not needed if you just want to test something, or do something quickly), for large-scale simulations it can be made to be faster than the implementations of Portegies Zwart's code in C/C++/fortran (https://github.com/paugier/nbabel).\n","\n","So how do we do this? It is normally possible to write python code that is just as fast as code written in a \"fast\" (compiled) language such as C. After all, python is written in C and contains a wealth of libraries, such as numpy, that actually use compiled C (and even fortran) code in some of the most time-sensitive places.\n","\n","I think its more accurate to say that its easier to write \"slow\" code in python, because it's often hard to see why some things are slow. To write code that *is* as fast as C does require a bit of understanding on how C actually works, but in most cases you can write code that is more than fast enough using the techniques shown here. In this lecture we will try to\n","\n","* Highlight some of the places where python code is often slow and demonstrate ways to speed it up\n","* Demonstrate tools to \"profile\" python code, specifically to identify the functions, and lines, where the code is slowest\n","\n","As a supplement to this, there are occasionally cases where python doesn't cut it in terms of speed. With the availability of numpy, *such cases are rare*. In such instances you can turn to \"Cython\" which is basically a hybrid of python and C/C++. We will cover Cython at the end of this course. Note that large parts of scipy are actually written in Cython, and while it is still nowhere near as well used as Python itself, it is increasing in popularity."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"RpsV1D6YSQ-M"},"source":["## Before we start\n","\n","Before we start we will need to use a couple of utilities to demonstrate some of the profiling techniques.

If you are using Anaconda (or Minconda or any other conda installed python) you will probably want to use the `conda` command shown below and commented out *instead*.

Never bother optimising any part of your code that is not taking a significant fraction of the total time.\n","* The optimal solution to a problem can depend on the input. For shorter inputs, converting an integer to a string and then back to a list of integers adds an overhead that is the dominant computational cost. However, as the input integers become very large, operations like dividing by 10 (which for a computer is not as trivial as it seems, because computers think in binary numbers, not base-10 numbers) become expensive (look up how python handles big integers if you want to understand this better). In this case the overhead of converting to a string is faster.\n","* Although the second case was faster for normal-sized integers, it doesn't seem that using it would really be a good decision if the code is more difficult to parse."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"heX-KFasSQ-S"},"source":["## Exercise 3 - Identifying common elements in two large lists\n","\n","\n","This interactive example demonstrates that is often important to use the right tool, or computational method, for the task at hand.\n","\n","An example of this is the problem I set you last year:\n","\n","Write a function numpy_nested_sum, which takes as input two 1D numpy arrays (x and y) with lengths N and M respectively and computes the following sum:\n","\n","$\\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \\sum_{j=0}^{M-1} \\left(x[i]^2 + y[j]^2 \\right)$\n","\n","Many of you tried something like\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":61,"metadata":{"id":"CrbfGqciDs3d","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713213151749,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":247,"user":{"displayName":"Ian Harry","userId":"12539231435418418952"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["def compute_sum(arrx, arry):\n","    summ = 0\n","    for i in range(len(arrx)):\n","        for j in range(len(arry)):\n","            summ += arrx[i]**2 + arry[i]**2\n","    return summ"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ot8kjpinDs3d"},"source":["This directly implements the question as written, but didn't pass the longest test case (due to timeout).

Making a sorting algorithm that is *fast* is very important and there are many different approaches to the problem (python, for example uses \"Timsort\"):\n","\n","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm\n","\n","There is a rule though: If you have an array that contains random input, then you will require an average of `O(N log(N))` operations to sort the array. If the array is *not* random though, this can be shorter (e.g. if the array is already sorted, this can be done in `O(N)`, which is the cost required to identify that the array *is* sorted.\n","\n","As this is the last exercise, let's make this challenging:\n","\n","* Write your own code that will take as input an array of numbers. Return a sorted *copy* of the array (the original array should be unchanged). Don't worry too much about making the code fast until you have something that works. When you have something that works, see how you can use the tools presented above to make it as fast as possible."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"zqHcoxfbSQ-T"},"outputs":[],"source":["import copy\n","def sort_array(unsorted_array):\n","    # This line will copy the array so that the input will be preserved.\n","    # After this you can do what you want to unsorted_array\n","    unsorted_array = copy.deepcopy(unsorted_array)\n","\n","    # FIXME: You need to fill this with code DO NOT use python's built-in sort/sorted routines (or any link to\n","    # that e.g. numpy.sorted).
